Decisions to date 

1. Ploxy based design
2. USB control board

End goal and performance requirements 

1. A1 plot size
2. Height sufficient for paintbrush
	1. 1. 30-50mm
3. Speed appropriate for large plot and return of paintbrush
		target 1m/s, max achievable with board for first iteration 
4. Accuracy 0.1mm 
5. Minimal cost
